# My Portfolio

My portfolio is a website that showcases my personal and professional projects, skills, and experience. It provides an overview of who I am, my objectives, educational background, relevant coursework, and skills. Additionally, it includes links to my email address and phone number for easy contact, as well as a link to my GitHub profile for viewing my code contributions. This website serves as a comprehensive platform for presenting my work and capabilities to potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in learning more about me.
